# Lab 07

**Author**: Scott Thompson and Jose Flores
**Version**: 1.0.7

## Overview
This is a blog article app that shows articles of authors chosen from a drop down menu. This app also allows a user from adding a new article.

## Getting Started
A user will need to install the proper servers like express and body parser. Know JS, HTLM, CSS and utilize a code editor such as VS Code. Ensure there are proper files installed such as package.json and package-lock.json. In the JS files a user will need to instate the express framework to configure the middleware to interact with the file system. Run the server to provide a live feed back system to ensure it is working properly.

## Architecture
Stored all our content in the Public folder and a server.js file to use the node server. A package.json and package-lock.json file to hold all of the dependencies installed.
